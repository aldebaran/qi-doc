qi::Session
***********

A session is what allows you to connect services together locally or over the
network. They can be used as server or client and can register or obtain
services (on all sides, even in multi-client). You can read the guides to
:ref:`register a service<guide-cxx-service>` and :ref:`get a
service<guide-cxx-client>`.
