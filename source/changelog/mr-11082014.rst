Merge Request - August 2014
===========================

Overview
********

This merge request is mostly a bugfix merge request. Lots of unit tests were
also fixed.

Python bindings
***************

waitForService
--------------

qi.Session.waitForService was bound in Python.

Async calls
-----------

Async calls were fixed. You can make an async call like this:

.. code-block:: python

  obj.myFunc(_async=True)

  future = session.waitForService("MyService", _async=True)

Using modules
-------------

You can now use modules from Python (though you still can't write them in
Python). You can load a module like this:

.. code-block:: python

  mod = qi.module("mymodule")
  cat = mod.createObject("Cat", "an argument")
  cat.meow()
