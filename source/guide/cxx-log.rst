Documentation of qi::log
************************

Introduction
============

Header: :cpp:`<qi/log.hpp>`

Overview
========

Log are hierarchical with "." as separator. Each level of hierarchy is called a
**category**.

For example, for an instant messaging service, categories may be:

.. code::

  im.audio
  im.audio.input
  im.audio.output
  im.audio.internal
  im.video
  im.video.internal
  im.http

This allows easy log filtering in external log tools.

There are 7 levels of log:

:silent: Hide logs.

:fatal: Used before the program exit.

:error: A classical error.

:warning: Useful to warn user.

:info: Useful to user information.

:verbose: Not mandatory but useful to user information.

:debug: Useful to developer. Not compile on release.

Writing logs
============

There is a log function for each level except **silent**. Those functions are
basic streams.

.. code-block:: cpp

  std::string msg = "Message to print with number: ";
  qiLogFatal("ca.te.go.ry")   << msg << 1;
  qiLogError("ca.te.go.ry")   << msg << 2;
  qiLogWarning("ca.te.go.ry") << msg << 3;
  qiLogInfo("ca.te.go.ry")    << msg << 4;
  qiLogVerbose("ca.te.go.ry") << msg << 5;
  qiLogDebug("ca.te.go.ry")   << msg << 6;

.. note::

  Do not add enlines manually, qi::log automatically adds them at the end of
  each message.

To avoid typing category each time (and so make mistakes), there is a scope
function to set it globally: :cpp:`qiLogCategory(const char*);`

.. note::

  It is always allowed to set a specific category for a message even if a global
  category is set.

.. code-block:: cpp

  qiLogCategory("ca.te.go.ry")

  qiLogFatal()   << "foo";
  qiLogError()   << "foo";
  qiLogWarning() << "foo";
  qiLogInfo()    << "foo";
  qiLogVerbose() << "foo";
  qiLogDebug()   << "foo";

.. warning::

  If log category is set globally in an include file, all files including this
  file will have this category as global category.

(A)synchronous logging
======================

Log are asynchronous, we dont want to waste time in log, furthermore log can do
networking. The handling of the log output is in a separated thread.

There is a way to disable asynchronous. Start naoqi with --synchronous-log command line
option. Be careful, it will slow down naoqi if you have lots of handlers.

Logs may be asynchronous, but they are actually being displayed in their request order.


Add/Remove Log Handlers
=======================

The default handler log to console. The color is enable on tty.
The handler can be added or deleted. You just need to give a delegate to a log function with the following prototype:

.. code-block:: cpp

  void logfct(const qi::LogLevel verb,
              const char         *category,
              const char         *msg,
              const char         *file = "",
              const char         *fct = "",
              const int          line = 0);

Then you can add the handler with :cpp:`addLogHandler(name, fctLog)`

.. code-block:: cpp

  :cpp:`addLogHandler("nameofloghandler", logfct);`

and remove it with removeLogHandler(name).

.. code-block:: cpp

  removeLogHandler("nameofloghandler");



Filtering logs output
=====================

It is possible to change the output of log in 3 different ways:

- category,
- level,
- context.

Level
+++++

**level** via :bash:`QI_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

If :bash:`QI_LOG_LEVEL` is set to :bash:`"fatal"` only **fatal** logs are
displayed.

if :bash:`QI_LOG_LEVEL` is set to :bash:`"info"`, **fatal**, **error**,
**warning** and **info** logs are displayed.

.. note::

  By default, level is set to **info**.

It is possible to use corresponding number instead of name of levels.

0. Silent
1. Fatal
2. Error
3. Warning
4. Info
5. Verbose
6. Debug

Context
+++++++

**context** are the meta information collected during the creation of log.

These information are:

- Level,
- Date,
- ThreadId,
- Category,
- File,
- Function.

To set context use :bash:`QI_LOG_CONTEXT`, which is a bit-field.

:1: Level as complete string
:2: Level as a single letter
:4: Date of emission
:8: ThreadId
:16: Category
:32: File name and line number
:64: Function name
:128: End of line

Useful values of contexts:

:26: Short level + threadId + category
:30: Short level + threadId + date + category
:126: Short level + threadId + date + category + file + function
:254: Short level + threadId + date + category + file + function + eol

Category filtering
++++++++++++++++++

**category** can be filtered via :bash:`QI_LOG_FILTERS` environment variable.

**-** is used to remove a category, **+** to add it, **:** is the separator.

.. code-block:: bash

  QI_LOG_FILTERS="-im.audio:+im.video"

:bash:`QI_LOG_FILTERS` support globbing.

.. code-block:: bash

  QI_LOG_FILTERS="-im*:+im.video*"

It is possible via :bash:`QI_LOG_FILTERS` to set different level of verbosity
for each category via **=**.

.. code-block:: bash

  # set level of verbosity to warning for im* except for im.video to debug.
  QI_LOG_FILTERS="+im*=3:+im.video=6"

.. warning::

  Due to this feature, use :bash:`QI_LOG_LEVEL` with :bash:`QI_LOG_FILTERS` may
  be hazardous.
