Tracing
=======

We need a tracing infrastructure to understand what's going on in the system.

We need to be able to display current running task, bandwith used for each services, frequency of calls for each methods.

It should be possible to activate the debug mode without too much performance penality.

We need a gui to follow what's going on. Choregraphe can display objects it seems pretty adapted to display activity between services/behaviors. We could support an inspect mode, where we can see what's going on the wire, what current task are being run, what function take time (time of execution of a slot).
